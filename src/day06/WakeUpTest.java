        * Day 6
        WAKE UP TASK :
        Create a program to calculate the final discounted price of an Item
        Create 3 double variables  called  regularPrice , salePrice and discount
        Ask user question using scanner for regularPrice and discountPercentage
        And save the result into the variable
        Calculate sale price using above information
        For example :  80 regular price , 0.2 for discount  , salePrice â€”>> 64
        Print out  : regular price is 80$ , discount is 0.2  and your got deal for 64 $
