        /*Task 1 :
        given 3 whole numbers variable num1, num2 , num3 with value already set .
        If the sum of the numbers are more than 100 print you have won
        if not print sum of 3 numbers are not more than 100
        Task 2 :
        given 3 whole numbers variable  num1, num2 , num3 with value already set .
        and another int variable called sumOfSpecialNumber with initial value 0
        Write a program to print
        Only the sum of numbers that more than 20
        for example  10, 25, 30 . --->> 25+30=55
        Task 3 :
        given 3 whole numbers variable num1, num2 , num3 with value already set .
        Write a program to
        find out the largest number and print the result
        Task 4 :
        given 3 whole numbers variable num1, num2 , num3 with value already set .
        Write a program with below logic
        it should print true if all the individual numbers are more than 100
        if not print not all numbers are more than 100
        Task 5 :
        given 3 whole numbers variable num1, num2 , num3 with value already set .
        Write a program with below logic
        add 100 to all the numbers less than 20 ;
        print out the value of each variable to test your code.
                Task 6 :
        given 3 whole numbers variable num1, num2 , num3 with value already set .
        Write a program with below logic

        if multiplication result of num1 and num2 greater than sum of all the numbers
        print excellent result
 else
        not the numbers combination I am looking for
